## 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course
These notebooks are from the [2024 GenAI course](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/545082) and the [2025 Agents course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-agents).

All steps on these notebooks were ran locally on my machine, with slight modifications to make them work outside of the Kaggle environment.

First there's some notebooks from the 2024 version: **5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course**
Then there's the notebooks from the 2025 version: **5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google**


### 2024_Day_01
On the first day the following things are explored:
- Sending simple prompts
- Creating conversations
- Explore parameters like temperature and top_p
- Zero shot, one shot, and few shot prompting
- Chain of thought in models
- Reason and act
- Thinking mode in models
- Prompting to generate or explain code
- Code execution

### 2024_Day_02
On the second day the following things are explored:

#### Document Q&A with RAG
- Storing documents embeddings in ChromaDB
- Querying the vector database
- Simplify response document contents

#### Exploring text similarity with embeddings
- Calculare similarity scores with semantic similarity
- Visualize similarities of all documents in a heatmap
- See the ranking of similarities for a given entry

#### Build a neural classification network with Keras using embeddings
- Finding an appropriate dataset (e.g. 20 newsgroups text dataset)
- Prepare and sample a dataframe with some desired categories using Pandas
- Use tqdm for creating a progress bar when creating a compute intensive dataframe (e.g. creating embeddings)
- Use Keras to create a classifier model to train with the embeddings and the corresponding category mappings
- Predict a certain text category by using its embeddings with the embeddings trained model

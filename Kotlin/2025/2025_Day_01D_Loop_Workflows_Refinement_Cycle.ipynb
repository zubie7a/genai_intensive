    "**The Problem: One-Shot Quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "        All the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n",

He’d traded a life of restless wandering for this stoic solitude, a choice he’d never regretted, not until this very moment. The sea had been his only companion, its moods more predictable than human nature. One blustery evening, while meticulously cleaning the Fresnel lens that had been his charge for three decades, his rag snagged on something tucked deep within a crevice. He pulled out a vellum scroll, brittle with age, yet strangely supple, as if preserved by more than just time.\n\nAs he unrolled it, a faint, ethereal glow emanated from the markings. It wasn't ink, he realized with a jolt, but lines of shimmering, cool blue light that traced unknown coastlines, dotted with constellations that mirrored no sky he'd ever seen. The air around the scroll seemed to grow warmer, charged with an unseen energy. In the center, a single, pulsating golden star marked a spot far beyond any charted ocean. Elias felt a strange vibration hum through the vellum, a resonant thrum that echoed the sudden, unfamiliar quickening of his own pulse. A shiver, not entirely from the wind, traced its way down his spine. Beneath the glowing star, almost lost in the luminescence, was a symbol – a coiled serpent biting its own tail – a sigil he’d never encountered in his extensive readings of maritime lore, nor in the whispered tales of previous keepers. Who had left this here, and why? The unanswered questions, as potent as the map's strange glow, stirred a forgotten ember of longing for the unknown within him, a feeling he thought had long since been extinguished by the steady rhythm of the waves and the solitary sweep of the lamp.The story is very well-crafted and evocative.\n\n**Plot:** The plot is compelling, centered around the discovery of a mysterious and potentially magical map. The inciting incident is strong and immediately creates questions for the reader. The introduction of the Ouroboros symbol adds a layer of ancient mystery.\n\n**Characters:** Elias is a well-established character. His thirty years of dedication to the lighthouse, his trade-off of wandering for solitude, and his immediate reaction to the map all paint a vivid picture of a man whose predictable world has just been irrevocably shaken. The \"forgotten ember of longing for the unknown\" is a perfect character beat.\n\n**Pacing:** The pacing is excellent. It begins with a grounded depiction of Elias's life, transitions smoothly into the discovery, and then unfolds the map's mysteries at a pace that builds wonder and a touch of apprehension. The final questions effectively leave the reader wanting more.\n\nThe story is well-written and complete as an introduction to a larger narrative.\n\nAPPROVEDAPPROVED"

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you made the leap from a single agent to a **multi-agent system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You saw **why** a team of specialists is easier to build and debug than one \"do-it-all\" agent. Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n",
    "\n",
    "You used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n",

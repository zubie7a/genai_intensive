    "The previous sequential agent is great, but it's an assembly line. Each step must wait for the previous one to finish. What if you have several tasks that are **not dependent** on each other? For example, researching three *different* topics. Running them in sequence would be slow and inefficient, creating a bottleneck where each task waits unnecessarily.\n",

    "**The Solution: Concurrent Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have independent tasks, you can run them all at the same time using a `ParallelAgent`. This agent executes all of its sub-agents concurrently, dramatically speeding up the workflow. Once all parallel tasks are complete, you can then pass their combined results to a final 'aggregator' step.\n",

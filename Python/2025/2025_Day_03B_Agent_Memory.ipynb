    "| Capability | What It Means | Example |\n",
    "|------------|---------------|---------|\n",
    "| **Cross-Conversation Recall** | Access information from any past conversation | \"What preferences has this user mentioned across all chats?\" |\n",
    "| **Intelligent Extraction** | LLM-powered consolidation extracts key facts | Stores \"allergic to peanuts\" instead of 50 raw messages |\n",
    "| **Semantic Search** | Meaning-based retrieval, not just keyword matching | Query \"preferred hue\" matches \"favorite color is blue\" |\n",
    "| **Persistent Storage** | Survives application restarts | Build knowledge that grows over time |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Imagine talking to a personal assistant:\n",
    "- 🗣️ **Session**: They remember what you said 10 minutes ago in THIS conversation\n",

    "**Think of callbacks as event listeners in your agent's lifecycle.** When an agent processes a request, it goes through multiple stages: receiving the input, calling the LLM, invoking tools, and generating the response. Callbacks let you insert custom logic at each of these stages without modifying the core agent code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Available callback types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `before_agent_callback` → Runs before agent starts processing a request\n",
    "- `after_agent_callback` → Runs after agent completes its turn  \n",
    "- `before_tool_callback` / `after_tool_callback` → Around tool invocations\n",
    "- `before_model_callback` / `after_model_callback` → Around LLM calls\n",
    "- `on_model_error_callback` → When errors occur\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common use cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logging and observability (track what the agent does)\n",

    "   - Both services are provided to the `Runner`\n",
